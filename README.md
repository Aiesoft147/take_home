## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

The project aims to design and implement a microservice-based application using Angular for the frontend, Python Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. 
The microservices will be containerized and managed using Kubernetes. Helm, a Kubernetes package manager, will be used to package and deploy the application. 
Tech stack: K8S, Docker, Helm, AWS, Terraform, Git/Github, Nexus, Jenkins, Sonarqube, Prometheus and Grafana.
We will maintain the backend outside our K8s cluster for this demo but in a container.
### Objectives

The key objectives of the project are as follows:

- Design and develop a microservice-based application using Angular, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL.
- Package the microservices with Helm to simplify deployment and management.
- Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated application building, testing, and deployment.
- Use Nexus as an artifact repository to manage binary artifacts and Docker images generated during the CI/CD process.
- Perform static code analysis with SonarQube to identify and address code quality and security issues early in the development cycle.
- Utilize Docker Hub as the container registry for storing and sharing Docker images.
- Set up Infrastructure as Code (IAC) using Terraform and the Amazon EKS module to provision and manage the Kubernetes cluster.
- Implement a monitoring and logging solution with Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application's performance and health.
- Adopt a "shift left" approach to security, integrating security practices into the development process from the outset.

## 2. Microservice Application Development

The microservice-based application consists of two main components:

### Frontend: Angular

Angular will be used to develop the user interface of the application. It provides a robust framework for building dynamic and responsive web applications.

### Backend: Python Django

Python Django will handle the backend logic of the microservices. It is a powerful web framework that simplifies the development of complex web applications.

### Database: PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL will serve as the database for storing application data. It is a reliable and feature-rich open-source relational database.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Set up a new Angular project for the frontend using the Angular CLI.
2. Design the user interface and implement the frontend functionalities.
3. Create a new Django project for the backend.
4. Design and implement the backend logic, including API endpoints.
5. Integrate PostgreSQL as the database backend for the Django application.
6. Test the frontend and backend components locally to ensure they function correctly.
7. Write Docker file for frontend and Docker compose for backend and push code to Github remote repo.

## 3. Version Control with GitHub

GitHub will be used as the version control system for the project. It provides a collaborative environment for tracking and managing code changes.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub to host the microservice-based application.
2. Initialize Git in the local project directory.
3. Connect the local repository to the GitHub remote repository.
4. Commit the initial frontend and backend code to the repository.

## 4. Artifact Management with Nexus

Nexus will serve as the artifact repository to manage binary artifacts, including Docker images, generated during the CI/CD process. It ensures consistent 
and reliable artifact management across the development pipeline.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Set up a Nexus repository manager to store artifacts.
2. Configure Nexus to serve as the Docker registry for storing Docker images.
3. Integrate the CI/CD pipeline to push Docker images to Nexus.

## 5. Static Code Analysis with SonarQube

SonarQube will be used to perform static code analysis. It will scan the source code for potential code quality, security, and maintainability issues. 
The analysis results will help identify code smells and vulnerabilities.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Install and configure SonarQube for code analysis.
2. Integrate the CI/CD pipeline to trigger code analysis on code commits.
3. Analyze the code quality, security, and maintainability metrics from SonarQube reports.

## 6. Container Registry using Docker Hub

Docker Hub will be used as the container registry to store and share Docker images generated during the CI/CD process. Docker images are essential for deploying microservices to Kubernetes.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create a Docker Hub account and repository for storing Docker images.
2. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.

## 7. Helm Chart Creation

Helm will be used to create Helm charts, which simplify the process of defining, installing, and upgrading applications on Kubernetes. 
The Helm charts will package the microservices for deployment.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create Helm chart templates for the frontend and backend microservices.
2. Define Kubernetes Deployment and Service configurations in the Helm charts.
3. Configure values.yaml files to manage configurable parameters in the Helm charts.

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

Two separate Jenkins pipelines will be implemented for the frontend and backend components of the microservice-based application. 
The pipelines will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster. 
Automated testing will be integrated to ensure code quality and functionality.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Install and configure Jenkins on a build server (EC2, on-premise or).
2. Set up Jenkins jobs for building and testing the frontend and backend microservices.
3. Configure Jenkins pipelines for containerisation (docker) and automated deployment to Kubernetes using Helm.

## 9. Infrastructure as Code (IAC) using Terraforms Amazon EKS Module

Terraform's Amazon EKS module will provision and manage the Kubernetes cluster. 
IAC enables consistent and repeatable provisioning of the Kubernetes environment.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Install and configure Terraform on the infrastructure management server.
2. Define Terraform configurations for provisioning an Amazon EKS cluster.
3. Apply the Terraform configurations to create the Kubernetes cluster.

## 10. Monitoring and Logging Solutions with Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus will collect and store metrics from the Kubernetes cluster, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting. 
Grafana will be used to visualize the collected data and create custom dashboards for monitoring the application's performance and health.
Alternatively, use AWS Cloudwatch. use aws provided Prometheus and configure it with your K8s cluster

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Install and configure Prometheus to collect metrics from Kubernetes.
2. Set up Grafana to visualize and monitor the collected metrics.
3. Create custom dashboards in Grafana to monitor the application's performance.

## 11. Security Measures - "Shift Left" Approach

A "shift left" approach to security will be adopted, emphasizing early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities. Security checks, such as

 Vulnerability scanning of Docker images will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address security issues proactively.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Integrate security checks into the CI/CD pipeline to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
2. Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address security-related code issues.
3. Implement secure coding practices and ensure the use of best security practices throughout development.

## 12. Conclusion

The project aims to design and implement a microservice-based application successfully, package it with Helm, and construct a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
The development process will be efficient and reliable by integrating best practices for version control, artifact management, static code analysis, and security measures.
The Kubernetes cluster provisioned using Terraform will provide a scalable and manageable environment for the microservices. The monitoring and logging solution will enable
effective monitoring and troubleshooting of the application. The "shift left" approach to security will ensure that safety is considered at every stage of the development
process, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the application. More details will be discussed during the presentation. Thank you!üòÅ
